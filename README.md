## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the dataset structure and data types
* Handle missing values and duplicates
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Visualize numerical and categorical features
* Identify outliers and correlations
* Determine important features for prediction

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on streaming platforms such as:

* Netflix
* Prime Video
* Disney+
* Hulu

It includes attributes like:

* Title
* Type (Movie / TV Show)
* Release year
* Duration
* Genre
* Country
* Platform availability

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data handling
* **Matplotlib** – visualizations
* **Seaborn** – statistical plots
* **Jupyter Notebook** – implementation

---

## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding

* Loaded the dataset using Pandas
* Inspected rows and columns
* Identified numerical and categorical features
* Checked missing values and duplicates

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Identified missing values using `.isnull().sum()`
* Applied:

  * Mean / median imputation for numerical columns
  * Mode imputation for categorical columns
* Removed duplicate rows
* Validated dataset after cleaning

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

* Histograms for numerical features
* Count plots for categorical features
* Box plots to detect outliers
* Correlation heatmap to understand relationships

### 4️⃣ Feature Analysis

* Identified important features such as:

  * Release year
  * Duration
  * Content type
  * Genre
  * Platform availability
* Analyzed which features are useful for prediction tasks

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Most content is released in recent years
* Categorical features dominate the dataset
* Duration shows presence of outliers
* Platform availability plays a key role in prediction
* Correlation among numerical features is limited

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

**Intern gains hands-on experience in:**

* Data preprocessing
* Handling missing values and duplicates
* Data visualization
* Feature understanding for machine learning

This project demonstrates readiness for **ML model development and predictive analysis**.
